## 📖 Learning Path

### Recommended Steps:

1. **Read the Notes First**: Start with the `.md` file in each day's folder to understand concepts
2. **Review the Code**: Look at the `.py` file to see code examples
3. **Run the Examples**: Execute the Python files to see output
4. **Experiment**: Modify the code and test your understanding
5. **Practice**: Write your own code based on what you've learned

### How to Use This Repository:

- **For Beginners**: Follow the days sequentially. Each day builds upon previous concepts
- **For Review**: Use the notes as a quick reference guide
- **For Practice**: Modify the code examples and experiment with variations

## 🎓 Best Practices for Learning

1. **Read Code First**: Before running code, read through it and understand what it does
2. **Type Code Yourself**: Don't just copy-paste; type the examples to build muscle memory
3. **Experiment**: Modify examples and see what happens
4. **Take Notes**: Create your own notes while learning
5. **Practice Consistently**: Dedicate time daily to coding
6. **Debug Errors**: If something doesn't work, try to understand why

## 🔧 Useful Commands

### Running Python
```bash
# Run a specific file
python filename.py

# Run Python interactive shell
python

# Check Python version
python --version
```

### Using the Terminal in Your Workspace
```bash
# Navigate to a directory
cd Day-01

# List files in current directory
ls  # macOS/Linux
dir # Windows

# Go back to parent directory
cd ..
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "python command not found"
- **Solution**: Python may not be in your PATH. Try `python3` instead

**Issue**: "SyntaxError: unexpected indent"
- **Solution**: Check indentation consistency. Python is whitespace-sensitive

**Issue**: "NameError: name 'x' is not defined"
- **Solution**: Ensure variable is defined before use

**Issue**: "ModuleNotFoundError"
- **Solution**: Check file name and ensure you're in the correct directory
