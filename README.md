## 🎓 Best Practices for Learning

1. **Read Code First**: Before running code, read through it and understand what it does
2. **Type Code Yourself**: Don't just copy-paste; type the examples to build muscle memory
3. **Experiment**: Modify examples and see what happens
4. **Take Notes**: Create your own notes while learning
5. **Practice Consistently**: Dedicate time daily to coding
6. **Debug Errors**: If something doesn't work, try to understand why

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "python command not found"
- **Solution**: Python may not be in your PATH. Try `python3` instead

**Issue**: "SyntaxError: unexpected indent"
- **Solution**: Check indentation consistency. Python is whitespace-sensitive

**Issue**: "NameError: name 'x' is not defined"
- **Solution**: Ensure variable is defined before use

**Issue**: "ModuleNotFoundError"
- **Solution**: Check file name and ensure you're in the correct directory
